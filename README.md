## Weather-Forecast

I am currently passing my last term break in my University. And it's a long vacation. I am bored. So I thought "Let's learn some React".

So I started learning **ReactJS** and this is my first project on **React**. 

It's nothing, I know. But hey, it's a start :P


## Libraries
The libraries I used here are:
1. [material-ui for react](https://material-ui.com/) 
2. lodash
3. [axios for sending request over the network](https://github.com/axios/axios)
4. redux
5. [react-scroll-up](https://github.com/milosjanda/react-scroll-up#readme) 
6. prop-types
